🧠 How to Learn From These Projects
Start small – Don’t try to build everything at once.

Focus on one topic per project (e.g., Retrofit, RecyclerView).

Break features into tasks (like “Implement RecyclerView for quote list”).

Google everything – That’s what pro developers do too!

Push code to GitHub – Build a portfolio.

🚀 Tools to Learn Along the Way
Retrofit – Networking/API calls

Room – Local database

ViewModel + LiveData – MVVM basics

Coroutines – Background work

Material Components – Better UI

If you want, I can help you choose one project, then guide you step-by-step through it — 
starting with UI, then logic, then storage or API. Just tell me what kind of app interests you most 
(anime, finance, productivity, weather, etc.) and I’ll tailor it to your level.
