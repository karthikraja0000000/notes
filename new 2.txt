Note for #nativeandroid:

To make your Android layouts look consistent on all screen sizes:

Use ConstraintLayout with percent-based sizes (layout_constraintWidth_percent, layout_constraintHeight_percent) instead of fixed dp values.

Calculate percent as:
percent = (design_size / design_screen_size)
Example: For a 157dp height in an 800dp design, use 157 รท 800 = 0.196.

This makes your UI elements scale proportionally on any device, matching your original design (like from Figma).

Avoid using fixed dp sizes for responsive layouts.

Percent-based layouts ensure your app looks good on different phones without extra manual adjustments.
